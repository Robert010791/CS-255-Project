This was the term project for CS-255 class. To begin we were given the transcript of an interview where a project lead and a system analyst where gathering information from a client. The cliet inclued the founder and the IT director. The goal of the project was to use the interview transcript to gather requiremetns and funcionality the client wanted in their web application and create business requirements and system design documents. The area I did best in this project was identifying the clients requirements and the are I would like to improve would be the diagrams.
